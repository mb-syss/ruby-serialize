Java Serializer in Ruby using Metamodel

Also:
+ Discovery of available gadget classes (blind + remote)
+ JRMP/RMI Client
+ JMX/RMI Scanning (related: metasploit modules available)

Currently ported payloads:
- Commons Collections (very portable variant)
- Commons Beanutils
- C3P0
- Groovy
- Hibernate Validator
- Jython
- ROME
- Spring JTA
- Hibernate ORM
- Rhino
- net.sf.JSON
- Beanshell


Pros:
- in many cases generates smaller payloads
- no need to carry around possibly hundreds of megabytes of 
  libraries/maven respositories (and possibly malicious code)
- metasploit integration
- directly inject meterpreter through serialized payloads
- addresses some other issues with practical use of ysoserial, including
   * proper shell commandsline handling
   * better support for payload variants
   * parametrization


See test*.rb for some usage examples
